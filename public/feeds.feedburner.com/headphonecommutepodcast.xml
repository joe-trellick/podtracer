                      <description><![CDATA[<p>About, oh, eight years ago now (jeez!) I featured a <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/2013/03/02/sirat-noir/'>Noir</a> mix by Sirat, a DJ from Spain who hand-picked his favourite downtempo and trip-hop tracks to create a tribute to film-noir, “with its characteristic anti-heroes, femmes fatales, gangsters and dirty dealings”. It was a fantastic stroll down the rain-refreshed alley, which received a lot of praise among the followers of the genre (including yours truly). It seems that the mix has also left a wonderful impression on its creator – enough to create a long-awaited follow-up, “returning to those smoky sounds, and black and white environments…” Once again, the intention here is for you to create your very own movie of your mind, and transport yourself “to the universe of film noir.” Enjoy the many familiar bits on here (like that lovely Portishead track!) and discover new artists along the way! Oh, and while you’re in the mood for further listening, check out Sirat’s <a href='https://soundcloud.com/sirat'>Soundcloud</a>, where you will find more mixes, as well as his productions as part <a href='https://soundcloud.com/climabass'>Clima</a> project.</p>

James and I have a mutual passion for sharing the music that we discover. A few years ago, he made an ambient focused <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/2017/11/15/james-heather-headphone-commute-mix/'>Headphone Commute Mix</a> for this very same podcast. Today I’m syndicating his selection originally appearing on his very own Moving Sounds program that he runs on London’s <a href='https://sohoradiolondon.com/profile/moving-sounds-with-james-heather/'>Soho Radio</a>. This monthly show “was born out of the long-running <a href='https://jamesheather.lnk.to/movingsounds'>playlist</a> of the same name created by James that explores spaces between classical, electronic, ambient, soul, jazz, drone, film soundtrack, folk, field recordings & other transporting sounds from the past but mostly from now.” This particular mix is featuring many of my favourite composers whom I am honoured to call friends, and I was even happy to contribute a track of my own. In the case of mixes, I always follow the “less words – more music” formula, so here you go, folks! Enjoy!</p>

In this example, a <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/2020/12/01/joachim-spieth-jiwa/'>track premiere</a> by Joachim Spieth at the end of last year made me relisten to his works on Wolfgang Voigt’s  Pop Ambient series, taking me to releases on his very own Affin imprint and finally asking him for a mix. In this process, this seemingly random stranger quickly became a musical friend, as we exchanged grand ideas and connected with music. I really appreciated the spectrum of electronic music genres covered on Spieth’s German label and requested that he showcased the output through a traversal of styles. The result is a beautiful 90-minute journey that will take you from soothing to upbeat, through highs and through lows. I’m very happy with how it turned out and honoured to host this showcase on Headphone Commute.</p>

<p>In November of 2020, Amsterdam-based label Ambientologist released a compilation titled Sustain Series, Vol. 1. It’s an impressive gathering of ambient artists and their music, showcasing some of the most delicate sides of the genre. The proceeds from the release have been donated to Conservation International, promoting sustainability across the world. I reached out to the label in hopes to broadcast this selection to a wider audience on my platform, and I am happy that they obliged to share this 90-minute continuous mix by Lauge with followers of my podcast. Take a look at the tracklisting and you will know why I’m excited to spend today in the company of my favourite ambient artists, as well as a few newly introduced names to my ears. As of this writing, the label is preparing a follow-up volume, with artists such as Halftribe, The Green Kingdom, Pepo Galán, awakened souls, Dylan Henner and Sven Laux, confirmed for the roster. I’m keeping my eye on the Ambientologist’s Bandcamp for the available pre-order, and so should you!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In anticipation of Matt Emery‘s upcoming six-track EP on Injazero Records, titled Spotlight Series : Cello, I have asked him to put together a thematic mix prominently featuring the instrument. As many of you may already know – I’m a big fan of this low-end stringed beast [side note: In high school, I’ve played the double bass in the orchestra, but I wasn’t very good and was jealous of the cello]. I have especially enjoyed the darker, moodier, and sullen pieces by the likes of <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/julia+kent/'>Julia Kent</a>, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/resina'>Resina</a>, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/Anne+M%C3%BCller/'>Anne Müller</a>, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/peter%20gregson'>Peter Gregson</a>, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/sebastian%20plano'>Sebastian Plano</a>, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/clarice%20jensen'>Clarice Jensen</a>, and of course, <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/hildur'>Hildur Guðnadóttir</a>, all of whom I have reviewed and interviewed on Headphone Commute before [I have linked up each name for HC content for you above], and who, once again, appear on this gorgeous mix selected by Matt Emery. His very own two pieces, one from the upcoming EP, and the other from his previously released album Empire, also appear on this podcast, which I hope you will thoroughly enjoy!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In December of 2020, one of my favourite imprints released a gorgeous label compilation! Ryan Griffin has been lovingly curating every single release on A Strangely Isolated Place since 2012. He’s also compiled sublime <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/search/strangely%20isolated%20reflection'>Reflection</a> mixes, which I have happily syndicated on Headphone Commute. Following the first label showcase launched in 2019, Ryan puts together ten tracks, including a few previously unavailable as individual pieces, that make up this 2020 Label Compilation. As a bonus, this release includes an hour-long continuous mix (available as part of a digital-only purchase), which I have arranged with Ryan to share with you today. “I hope the (continuous) year-end mix will become a regular occurrence going forward,” says Griffin about the release. “Many of you will know a big part of my inspiration and passion lies in DJ’ing and classic mix CDs. If the label momentum continues and releases keep coming as planned, then each year I’d like to invite a DJ to select and mix tracks from the label – make an annual tradition out of it.” This compilation is still available for purchase on a CD for only $10, while the digital-only album is up for grabs for only $1! Please see this label <a href='https://astrangelyisolatedplace.bandcamp.com/album/2020-label-compilation'>Bandcamp</a> page.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>What’s this? Somehow, last year, both Mathias Van Eecloo and I completely forgot our annual tradition to publish another eisOtones instalment, in which this prolific French musician and label(s) owner collects 50 tracks from 50 releases of the prior year. How did that happen? I suppose, Mathias was extremely busy wrapping up his monumental Eilean Rec. project, in which he released 100 records based on an imaginary map of 100 points. The final catalogue entry in this imprint [as you can imagine] was number 100 and collected unreleased pieces in an <a href='https://eileanrec.bandcamp.com/album/various-artists-eilean-100'>82-track compilation</a>. Van Eecloo wasted no time there and immediately set off on another venture, titled LAAPS, releasing vinyl records in a permanent continuity of sounds and visual bridges between each one. Another puzzle for you to complete! So I suppose it was a very busy time of endings and new beginnings… but this year we’re back! So, without more words and reflected distractions, here’s a 72-minute journey, which I’m sure you’ll enjoy!</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, it’s almost the end of this dreadful year, and I’ve got one more mix for you before I sign off… This one is episode number 290. Can you believe it? By the way, I was recently forced (by my host) to take all of my past mixes offline. As a result, I’ve migrated the last year of mixes to Podbean. So if you are experiencing any technical difficulties with downloading, streaming, or anything else, please reach out, and we’ll sort it! Meanwhile, this beautiful selection from noition, who last contributed his <a href='https://headphonecommute.com/2017/11/29/noition-child-of-nature/'>child of nature</a> mix back in 2017, should get you smooth sailing into the new year. Just look at that amazing tracklist! It’s been on rotation in Headphone Commute studios for a week now (vinyl crackle and all), so as you play it, you can imagine that we’re sharing this experience together, a better thought than listening alone. Anyway, I wish you all serenity, poised mental strength, and healthy choice in lifestyle! I’ll see you [virtually] next year when I return with my Best of 2020 selections!</p>

I intend on keeping all of the above going [more on this one a bit later!], with a bit of cross-pollination with Headphone Commute. Most of you already know that I enjoy solo piano and contemporary classical music, and I’m sure many followers of Contemplative Classical will appreciate my musings on here about ambient and cinematic music. I kind of hate to use the word “synergy” but if there was ever one of an appropriate union, it would be HC + CC.  Today I wanted to introduce you to the outstanding selection of mixes previously appearing on Contemplative Classical, with the syndication of this gorgeous selection of tracks by a Peruvian pianist and a composer, Sergio Díaz De Rojas. He is also responsible for a site and a label called <a href='https://www.pianoandcoffee.com/'>Piano and Coffee</a>, so you’re in good company here!

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Shimmering Moods is an independent boutique ambient label based in Amsterdam. In the last couple of years, it has released albums by Halftribe, Andrew Tasselmyer, Anthéne, øjeRum, Purl, and Olan Mill, among the many recognized names in its quickly growing roster of artists. It’s easy to get lost in its catalog among the hazy, shuffling, dubbed-out sounds, glinting and shimmering, reflecting the light off the still misty waters. This is a very tranquil and radiant place, slightly subdued in its faint hazy colors. “The music offers the listener a soundtrack for daydreaming, walks around the city or in nature, a creative activity, meditation, or invites them to a fully concentrated listen.” Today I am happy to share these sounds with you in this special label showcase compiled exclusively for Headphone Commute. And if you like what you hear, be sure to visit the label’s Bandcamp shop, where every limited release is lovingly packaged, hand-made, and bespoke, awaiting to meet at your doorsteps and share its wonders.

These, of course, include selections released on his own imprint, as well as remixes and collaborations [including one with yours truly] on the extended family of labels, such as Subcontinental, Ultimae, and Home Normal. Among the choices, you’d be happy to hear an Alva Noto cover of The Cure‘s “A Forest”, an excerpt from a beautiful long-form track by An Moku &amp; Stijn Hüwels titled Where We Meet (I’ve got some proper coverage on this release coming up!), and a top pick from our very own album, coming out in just a week, titled Suññatā, on November 17th. This particular episode appeared on October 17th at CAMP, a broadcasting platform for artists offering a “diverse array of audible pleasures,” but for my own taste, I’m not gonna lie, there’s only room for Slowcraft… For a more detailed description, full tracklisting, and more information about this mix, please visit headphonecommute.com</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For this 285th Headphone Commute Mix, James Norman puts together a selection of tracks as a companion listening session to his recently published book, titled “Micro Record Label: A love letter for music fans; a how-to for the hopeless; a light-hearted, humorous, self-deprecating detour for the uninterested.” The paperback is both a fun read and an important and earnest bit of advice for anyone who even conceives of venturing into a running a small, or rather, a micro record label. Covering everything from design to packaging to promoting and finally selling your goods, this 144-page diary captures the current state of affairs in the music scene outside of the music business. Along the way, Norman mentions many of his favorite releases across various imprints that just seem to do it right. This mix features many of such pieces quoted in the book and serves as a perfect musical journey and as a soundtrack to his recorded words. There are only 200 of these printed, so I recommend that you grab your copy (I see some still available on Rough Trade). Meanwhile, if you want to read an excerpt, you can read this chapter on “Identity” on Headphone Commute.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bigo & Twigetti is a London based label which, in recent years, has brought us an eclectic selection of artists ranging from ambient to electronic to contemporary classical genres and everything in between. Most recently, I’ve been inspired by Ben Crosland and his album The Turn as well as captivated by the always excellent Leah Kardos [who still owes me an introduction to her best friend, Dudley]. Leah has previously made us a Headphone Commute Mix, but for this installment, I’ve asked her to compile a sampler of the label’s offerings to showcase the catalog and hopefully discover some new acts. It’s an eclectic selection of tunes, perfect for your WFH commute. For a more detailed description, full tracklisting, and more information about this mix, please visit headphonecommute.com</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter van Cooten of Ambientblog is no stranger to Headphone Commute. We have been musing on our discoveries for almost a decade now, exchanging mixes and words in a tightly knit musical network. His first mix for Headphone Commute podcast appeared back in 2011, titled Dawn Secrets and it features many of my favorite artists to this day. I think it's only fair to say that Dave Michuda of Low Light Mixes is also part of the said "network", with his first mix for Headphone Commute appearing in August of 2010 (also a decade ago), titled The Landscape Listens. For this special syndicated podcast, Dave and Peter create a cooperative voyage, each taking their turns to conduct and maneuver this ship in complex sonic waters to deliver you safely ashore, while in the process forever tattooing their message on your map of existence. Enjoy! For a more detailed description, full tracklisting, and more information about this mix, please visit headphonecommute.com</p>

Wolfgang Röttger, who records under his moniker Morgen Wurde. About three years ago, I was completely mesmerized by his "Assassinous Act" for Time Released Sound which is still appearing on my occasional rotations. He has also contributed to the long-running Pop Ambient compilation series, curated by the one and only Wolfgang Voigt.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to understand the present, sometimes one must look into the past. It is, after all, the memories that make up the “you” of who you are. If you are to erase them, and your past, would you be an entirely new person? Perhaps you’ll make the same mistakes again. And buy all that expensive vinyl. In the case of Orangewarrior, the past includes a collection of electronic and ambient music of the mid-90s. And that precisely coincides with my very own “becoming” of the time, which is why I’m very much excited about this special mix. This is a fun journey down memory lane which I hope you will enjoy with us.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Gavin Miller is back, this time with his worriedaboutsatan project, showcasing some of his favourite pieces, including a few of his own, like the opener taken from his latest release for n5MD. We live in a strange and unstable world, but the only constant that remains is all of this music. So when I find myself overwhelmed with the latest events, I turn to meditation through sound, with a journey curated by someone else. Through this mix, I feel like we are listening together, and as such, connected again. 'I made this mix with not much in mind, to be honest,' says Miller of his selection, 'I’ve been listening to all sorts of music lately, and I just wanted it to be a fair reflection of that more than anything.'

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Time goes by. Time stands still. Time loops upon itself. And if it wasn’t for the sound, changing as it flows through time, and for the clouds, nudging time as they pass through, we wouldn’t even notice all the changes. Was it really you, a month ago, a year and a decade, and was it really me? Or is it still somewhere out there, in other space, in other time? And as we measure time in colors of the seasons, in the music of the spheres, and in the ever-present change, it’s through transitions of ourselves, in time, that we experience this ‘living’. Today’s mix is inspired by such passages through time. And as time appears to stand still, we may be experiencing an enormous transition for the entire humankind. It’s better with this music.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have a 3.5 hour showcase by Roel Funcken, who has put together a Sampler Mix from a double-volume Australia Bushfire Compilation, which he has curated for Touched Music. This is a benefit release approaching 70+ tracks selected from the musicians around the world to raise funds 'for the rescue, preservation and safe sanctuary of koalas and other vulnerable wildlife affected by the unprecedented catastrophic fires of the Australian Black Summer (September 2019 – February 2020) resulting in a massive loss of habitable forests.' Yes, during the current global [human] crisis it’s easy to forget about the disaster that has recently occurred on a remote continent, but it’s important to remember and support this endangered species in the time of need. I hope you enjoy and support this endeavor by purchasing the compilation, as 100% of the profits will be donated to Australians for Animals for Koala Habitat.

As you may have already guessed, Arandel’s work interprets the German composer’s sacred music into an updated formation of modern classical and contemporary electronic sound. In March of 2018, Arandel participated in the Bach Marathon at the Cite de la Musique Hall, Paris with his hybrid live performance and DJ set 'Switched on Bach', named in acknowledgment to the legendary 1968 Grammy Award-winning album by the American composer Wendy Carlos. 'Switched-on InBach' re-engineers the original mix played by Arandel with the perfected and mastered versions from his album 'InBach' alongside some amazing artists, such as Francesco Tristano, Murcof, and Sutekh.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This mix was originally broadcast on Headphone Commute in December of 2012. It was created to promote the benefit compilation, under the same name, … and darkness came, and in the process showcase the diverse sonic landscape of music featuring just a handful of tracks from the release. Well, it’s been over eight years since those events, but the music is as pungent as ever, especially during these devastating times, when you can find comfort in its sound. In the last couple of weeks, I found myself revisiting these compositions, and after some thought, I decided to reshare this somber mix. I hope that you’ll connect with it again and, in the process, spread the love to those in times of need. And as always, please enjoy responsibly and support the featured artists!

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For today’s podcast, we are featuring an outstanding label showcase for LINE, mixed by the one and only Richard Chartier. For this mix, which is also available at Name Your Price on Line’s Bandcamp [I highly recommend you grab the lossless version there!], Chartier showcases works from the most recent and back catalog of his monumental label, in the process creating more than just a label sampler, but a journey of its own. If this is your first foray into minimalism, sound art, and microsound spearheaded by LINE, then strap yourself in as you discover the many intimate layers in this most intricate of genres. The loyal followers of this monumental imprint will be happy to discover a few recent inclusions, such as a piece by Six Microphones, or the most recent release from Joaquín Gutiérrez Hadid, as well as some flashbacks to the earlier pieces by Asmus Tietchens, William Basinski + Richard Chartier, and of course, an appearance by Pinkcourtesyphone. A wonderful exhibition, which, once again, I urge you to support by purchasing this mix, or the albums appearing on it, directly from the label.
